# Default Environments
# Each tool can have a default conda environment specified here
# If no specific model is used, the default is biopipelines containing pyyaml and pandas (it is automatically created when submitting via submit)
# If the tool itsef manages the change to an environment (e.g. when it needs more than one environment), set it to null
