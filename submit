# SLURM Submission Script for BioPipelines
#
# This script submits a BioPipelines job to SLURM, mimicking the functionality
# of going to job composer and running the job with the suggested job name.
#
# Usage:
#     ./submit.sh [pipeline_name] [job_name]
#
# If no arguments provided, will look for the most recent pipeline output.
