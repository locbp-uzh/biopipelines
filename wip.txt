- colab
- Panda.filter("RMSD < 1.5 and plddt > 80") 1 vs 2, different reasons?
- Mutagenesis mutations vs mutation<N>
- ids general utils. merge(on=["id","compounds.ids"]). boltz default = "auto" possibly "proteins.ids|ligands.ids". 
? boltz affinity = ligand vs DNA/RNA?? check for multiple copies of same ligand!!
- ReMap ids function
- LoadOutput should change the base directory of every filter. It should accept the folder (it anyway contains .expected output)
- Log file in each folder too
