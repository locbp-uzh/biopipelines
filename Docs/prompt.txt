Read Docs/UserManual.md.
Understand the difference between pipeline and slurm runtime. 
Understand the organization of the repository and the relationship between biopipelines and HelpScripts. 
Understand the folder configuration on the cluster. 
This session is run on a local computer, not on the cluster, so home, data, scratch, shares are not accessible, the environments are not set, and no tool requiring a gpu can run.
Remember that tools shouldn't write python code, only bash code, and python code meant to run at slurm runtime should be in HelpScripts (pipe_ scripts for tools).
Read Docs/ToolReference.md for a broad idea of which tools are available.
Read HelpScripts/biopipelines_io.py.
When implementing new code or refactoring, never introduce unnecessary fallbacks or guessed default values.
